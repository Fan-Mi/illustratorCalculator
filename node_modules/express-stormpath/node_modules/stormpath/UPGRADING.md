# Upgrade Guide

### Version 0.14.0 -> Version 0.15.0

If you were relying on this module to enrich your client configuration with
a Stormpath application and default account store, you will need to move
that strategy, `EnrichClientFromRemoteConfigStrategy()`, into your application's
client configuration strategy list (it is no longer done by this library).
